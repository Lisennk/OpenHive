# OpenHive
OpenHive is a public version of cazala / coin-hive-stratum (CoinHive Stratum Proxy) which allows you to use CoinHive's JavaScript miner on a custom stratum pool without renting your own server and in just a few clicks.

* You can use any stratum pool
* You do not need your own server, you can configure everything from the client side
* Our hoster guarantees high uptime
* Our own fee is 0% (vs 30% fee by original CoinHive)
* 100% secure

### How to use it?

You can use it like regular cazala / coin-hive-stratum proxy

### Why you do this? What is your profit?

If OpenHive will be popular we will prodive small fee 0.5-1%. But now you can use it absolutely for free.
